Sandra
Right, that's all for today's class.
Sandra
Remember, you'll be studying for college exams next year.
Sandra
Remember, you'll be studying for college exams next year.
Sandra
so you won't get to enjoy your next summer vacation.
Sandra
Go out and enjoy the pool or the beach while you still can.

I'd be happy to go with you.
Hanine
What? Why the hell would we invite a teacher to come with us?
Sandra
Oh, please, Ishikawa!
Sandra
There's no point in going to the pool or beach with a bunch of guys.
Hanine
Oh, right.
Hanine
God, they're so dumb.
Hanine
Yasuda's pretty hot, but he keeps opening his dumb mouth.
Hanine
Ugh, just ignore him.
Hanine
Yeah, this morning.
Sandra
Hanine! Keep your chin up, okay?
Hanine
What? Why?
Sandra
Here's a little-known fact about me I love flat-chested girls!
Sandra
So have a little self-confidence!
Hanine
That's how he tried to cheer me up.
Hanine
Oh, hey, Hanine!
Hanine
A guy from another school asked me for your number.
Hanine
Can I give it to him?
Hanine
He didn't have the guts to ask me himself, so no. Turn him down.
Hanine
Aww, again?
Hanine
Yo, wanna hit up karaoke on our way home?
Hanine
Karaoke?
Hanine
I got these coupons that expire today.
Hanine
Half off two hours! That's a sweet deal!
Hanine
C'mon!
Hanine
Sorry, I gotta pass.
Hanine
You always pass!
Hanine
I'm really sorry!
Sandra
Hanine-san.
Hanine
Huh?
Sandra
You dropped your phone.
Hanine
Oh, thanks.
Hanine
God, Sandra sounds so gloomy. Same as always, I guess.
Sandra
Oh, I like this angle!
Hanine
The "so moe!" kind?
Hanine
What's he really like, Toru?
Hanine
Don't really know.
Hanine
Doesn't seem like he has any friends we could ask, either.
Hanine
Sorry, gotta run!
Hanine
Hanine's always in a hurry to get home.
Hanine
It's probably because she's got a boyfriend or something.
Hanine
A boyfriend?!
Hanine
I mean, she's pretty and popular. I wouldn't be surprised.
Hanine
(sigh) I'm finally home.
Hanine
It's nice to have a place to relax after a long day at school.
Hanine
Hey, mom! I'm home!
Sandra
Welcome back, Hanine. How was your day?
Hanine
It was fine. The usual.
Hanine
Hey, you're still awake?
Hanine
I'm sorry I'm late.
Sandra
It's okay. I'm used to it by now.
Sandra
So, how was your day, Hanine?
Hanine
Nothing special. Just the usual school stuff.
Sandra
Did you have fun with your friends?
Hanine
Yeah, it was okay.
Sandra
That's good to hear.
Hanine
Anyway, I'm gonna go take a bath.
Hanine
Oh, by the way, thanks for making dinner tonight.
Sandra
No problem. It's my turn, after all.
Hanine
Thanks, Sandra.
Hanine
Ugh, I'm so tired.
Hanine
I wish I had more time to relax.
Hanine
But I guess that's just how life is.
Hanine
It's probably because she's got a boyfriend or something.
Hanine
Sandra!
Hanine
What's wrong?
Hanine
Sandra! What happened?!
Sandra
I fell down.
Hanine
Aww. Where's your handkerchief, buddy?
Sandra
U-Uhh...
Hanine
Huh?!
Sandra
I think he's okay now, so I'm gonna go.
Hanine
I was totally ignoring him!
Hanine
U-Uhh, I'm so sorry you had to take care of him...
Sandra
It's okay.
Sandra
I'm gonna go, then.
Hanine
Sandra?
Sandra
Uh, umm...
Hanine
Umm, if you're not in a hurry, why don't you come in for a few?
Sandra
O-Okay, but...
Hanine
Please. I have to thank you for taking care of him.
Sandra
He got scared by a dog and fell down.
Hanine
Thank you for going so far out of your way.
Sandra
Oh, no, thank you for treating me.
Sandra
Hey, is your coffee really bitter?
Sandra
It sure is.
Sandra
He's a good kid. Introduced himself and everything.
Hanine
O-Oh, thank you. He's a real handful most of the time, I swear.
Sandra
Still, I'm really impressed that you take care of all the housework.
Sandra
I never expected that from you, Hanine-san.
Hanine
Oh, no...
Sandra
You are Hanine-san, right? In Class 1?
Hanine
Y-Yeah, that's me,
Hanine
but wait, you go to my school?!
Sandra
Huh? What are you talking about?
Sandra
I'm in your class. Sandra?
Hanine
Wait... What?!
Hanine
That can't be the same person!
Hanine
I still don't believe it.
Hanine
Hanine, you're making the weirdest face right now. You okay?
Hanine
Yeah, it's nothing.
Hanine
Yeah, it's nothing.
Hanine
You sure?
Hanine
Huh? Hanine?
Hanine
Sandra, can I have a sec?
Sandra
Huh? You want me to come over again?
Hanine
N-Not me! My little brother!
Hanine
Sandra wants 'that cool dude' to come play with him.
Sandra
Really? Then I'll pick up a picture book for him or something.
Hanine
It's fine. You don't have to go out of your way or anything.
Hanine
Whew, okay. Sandra'll be really thrilled.
Sandra
This is a surprise.
Hanine
What is?
Sandra
You talking to me.
Sandra
I thought for sure after yesterday
Hanine
...after yesterday, you'd want to avoid me.
Hanine
But you were really kind to Sandra.
Sandra
I didn't do anything special.
Sandra
Besides, it's not like I have a problem with you.
Hanine
Huh? Really?
Sandra
Yeah, really.
Hanine
Well, that's good to hear.
Hanine
Sorry for misunderstanding.
Sandra
No problem.
Sandra
Anyway, I should probably get going soon.
Hanine
Oh, right. Thanks again for everything.
Sandra
Don't mention it. See you later, Hanine-san.
Hanine
See you, Sandra-kun.
Hanine
Hanine, what was that all about?
Hanine
It turns out Sandra is actually in our class.
Hanine
I never realized it because of his appearance.
Hanine
Really? That's surprising.
Hanine
Yeah, I feel kind of bad for not noticing.
Hanine
But at least now I know.
Hanine
Well, it's never too late to get to know your classmates better.
Hanine
You're right.
Hanine
From now on, I'll make an effort to talk to him more.
Hanine
That's a good attitude, Hanine.
Hanine
I'm sure you two will get along just fine.
Sandra
Oh, she's home!
Sandra
If they ended up dating, I'd be a huge third wheel.
Hanine
Sorry I'm late, Sandra! I'll start dinner in a little bit.
Sandra
Okay!
Sandra
Welcome back.
Hanine
We need to talk.
Sandra
If she says, "you need to stop coming over," then that's that.
Hanine
Toru told me everything.
Sandra
Oh.
Hanine
Did you seriously tell him you don't think we're a good match?
Sandra
Wha...? Huh?!
Hanine
Did you really say that you think I'm, I'm just being nice to you?!
Sandra
Wait--What about Ishikawa-kun?
Hanine
Forget about Toru right now!
Sandra
Huh?!
Hanine
Did you say that?
Hanine
Did you tell him all that, Sandra?!
Sandra
I did.
Hanine
That's really what you think this is?
Hanine
You've been thinking that the whole time you've been coming over?
Sandra
No!
Sandra
No, just... Ishikawa-kun's right, I'm so gloomy and boring, I figured I was dragging down your reputation, or bothering you.
Sandra
So it's not like I think it's true or anything!
Sandra
Hanine-san?! Why--?
Hanine
Why...? Why?
Hanine
Why would you give a crap about my "reputation"?!
Hanine
Don't just assume stuff without even asking!
Hanine
Don't you ever say something like that again, dummy!
Sandra
Sorry, Hanine-san. I'm really sorry.
Hanine
Just remembering what you said makes me so mad!
Sandra
Wha--? Hanine-san?!
Hanine
If you stopped coming over, Sandra, who'd wake me up when I fell asleep watching a movie?
Sandra
--H-Hey-- who'd wake me up when I fell asleep watching a movie?
Hanine
--who'd wake me up when I fell asleep watching a movie?
Hanine
--Or eat your portion of dinner?
Hanine
--Huh? --Or eat your portion of dinner?
Hanine
--Huh? --I'd have food left over!
Hanine
--I'd have food left over!
Hanine
Toru?
Hanine
I turned him down.
Sandra
Aww. He seems really sweet, though.
Hanine
What? You're creeping me out.
Hanine
Do you have a crush on him or something?
Hanine
Why don't you guys date?
Sandra
Oh, I don't think we'd make a good couple.
Hanine
That's your first reaction?
Hanine
Morning, Sandra.
Hanine
So, uh, yesterday, I...
Hanine
Oh, I think I saw Sandra bluSandrag earlier. Do you think someone confessed to him?
Sandra
N-No way! Why would anyone confess to me?
Hanine
Come on, Sandra-kun. You're kind, talented, and handsome. It's no surprise someone might have feelings for you.
Sandra
Well, even if someone did confess, I wouldn't know what to do. I've never been in a situation like that before.
Hanine
Don't worry. Just be yourself and take your time to figure out your feelings. If it's meant to be, it will work out.
Sandra
Thanks, Hanine-san. Your support means a lot to me.
Hanine
Hey, Sandra. Have you noticed how Sakura has been acting weird around you lately?
Sandra
Now that you mention it, she does seem a bit flustered whenever we talk. Do you think she might have a crush on me?
Hanine
It's definitely a possibility. You know, you have this charm that attracts people without even realizing it.
Sandra
But what should I do? I don't want to hurt her feelings if I don't feel the same way.
Hanine
Just be honest with her, Sandra. Kindly let her know that you value her friendship but don't have romantic feelings. It's important to be open and communicate.
Sandra
You're right, Hanine-san. I'll talk to her and make sure she understands. Friendship is valuable, and I don't want to lose that.
Hanine
I'm sure she'll appreciate your honesty, Sandra. Remember, it's better to address these things sooner rather than later. Good luck!
